title: Human-in-the-Loop & Oversight
---



Graduated autonomy — agents run freely until risk crosses a threshold, then humans step in seamlessly.

### Key Features

- Async approvals via Slack / Teams / dashboard
- Rich context in approval requests (full prompt, tool call, parameters, risk score)
- Timeout + escalation (no response in 5 min → notify manager)
- Approve / Deny / Modify / Comment (comments saved in audit trail)
- Bulk approvals + delegation
- Custom webhook support for internal systems

### Outcomes

- High-stakes actions (money movement, prod changes, bulk emails) always reviewed
- Low false-positive rate — only real risks interrupt flow
- Full audit trail of who approved what and why
