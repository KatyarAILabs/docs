title: Policy & Governance Engine
---



Intent-aware authorization — decide what agents can do based on business context, not just endpoints.

### Key Features

- Visual policy builder (no-code for most rules)
- Cedar policy language for complex conditions
- Default-deny model
- Conditions: amount, time-of-day, user context, environment, agent group
- Native **MCP Hub** — tool discovery + schema validation + parameter enforcement
- Tool visibility filtering (marketing agent never sees HR database)

### Common Patterns Supported

- Escalation ladder (refunds `$100` auto, `$10k` VP approval)
- Time-based (outside business hours → require approval)
- Environment separation (prod = strict, dev = log-only)
- Gradual rollout (week 1: monitor, week 4: enforce)

### Outcomes

- Enforce business rules directly in the agent runtime
- Prevent shadow AI from accessing unauthorized systems
- One-click policy changes across hundreds of agents
