The **Dashboard** is your central command center in Katyar.  
After logging in, this is the first view you'll see — it gives you an instant overview of AI agent activity, compliance status, pending actions, and system health.

You can always return to the Dashboard by clicking the **Katyar logo** in the top-left corner or selecting **Dashboard** from the sidebar.

The dashboard updates in real time. Any new events, approvals, policy changes, or agent activity will appear automatically.
