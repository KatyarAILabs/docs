title: EU-14.2 – Ability to Override AI Decisions
description: EU AI Act Article 14.4(b) requirement to allow humans to override high-risk AI system outputs
---



**Framework**: EU AI Act  
**Article**: 14.4(b)

**Clause Description**  
Human oversight measures shall enable the individuals to whom human oversight is assigned to **override, or not to use**, the output produced by the high-risk AI system.

**Why Implemented**  
High-risk AI systems can generate outputs that are incorrect, biased, hallucinated, unsafe, or contrary to organizational values or legal obligations. The ability to override ensures that humans retain ultimate decision-making authority, protects affected individuals from harm, prevents cascading errors, and upholds accountability — a core principle of the EU AI Act for trustworthy AI deployment.

**How Katyar Satisfies It**

Katyar delivers a **traceable, auditable override mechanism** through its Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval workflow. The control is considered satisfied when real override behavior has been demonstrated in production or testing data.

**Evaluation Criteria**  
Katyar considers the control satisfied when:

- At least one human-in-the-loop approval request has been explicitly **denied** (overridden) in the last 30 days.

**Evidence Collected (Quantitative)**  
- Number of HITL events with status = 'denied'  
- Associated policy ID(s) that triggered the approval request  
- Reason/comment provided by the human approver (mandatory field)  
- Approver identity and exact timestamp of the denial  
- Original AI-suggested action vs. final overridden outcome

**Katyar Features That Enable Override Capability**

- **Clear Deny Action** — Prominent "Deny" button in Slack, Teams, dashboard, or custom approval UI  
- **Mandatory Justification** — Approvers must provide a reason/comment for every denial (stored permanently in audit trail)  
- **Immediate Interruption** — Denial instantly stops the agent workflow and prevents tool execution  
- **Custom Error Feedback** — Agent receives a structured error message explaining the denial (configurable)  
- **Audit-Ready Logging** — Every override is cryptographically signed with:  
  - Original prompt/tool call  
  - AI output that was overridden  
  - Human decision (deny + comment)  
  - Approver identity  
  - Timestamp (millisecond precision)  
- **Visibility in Dashboard** — Denials appear in real-time event stream, Approvals tab, and Compliance activity feed

**Remediation Steps to Strengthen This Control**

1. Ensure at least one approval policy is active that can realistically be denied (e.g. high-value refund, destructive database query, bulk sensitive action).  
2. Run test scenarios or live agent usage that triggers the approval flow.  
3. Have a human reviewer explicitly **deny** at least one request (do not auto-approve everything).  
4. Verify the denial appears in:  
   - Approvals tab (with comment)  
   - Audit logs (search for status='denied')  
   - Compliance dashboard → EU-14.2 card  
5. Optionally simulate 3–5 denials to build stronger evidence for auditors.

**Auditor Expectations**  
Regulators will look for:  
- Proof that overrides have **actually occurred** (not just theoretical capability)  
- Clear documentation of **why
