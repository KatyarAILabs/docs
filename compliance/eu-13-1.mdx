title: EU-13.1 – Transparency to Deployers & Users
description: EU AI Act Article 13 – ensuring sufficient transparency for deployers to interpret and use high-risk AI outputs appropriately
---



**Framework**: EU AI Act  
**Article**: 13

**Clause Description**  
High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way as to ensure **sufficient transparency** to enable deployers to interpret the system’s output and use it appropriately.  
High-risk AI systems shall be accompanied by instructions for use in an appropriate digital format or otherwise that include concise, complete and clear information that is relevant, accessible and comprehensible to deployers.

**Why This Control Exists**  
Transparency is essential for responsible deployment of high-risk AI. Without clear insight into how outputs are generated, deployers may misinterpret results, over-rely on incorrect decisions, or fail to detect limitations, biases or errors. This control protects end-users, supports contestability of decisions, and enables safe and ethical use — especially when outputs affect health, safety, fundamental rights or legal status.

**How Katyar Helps Achieve Compliance**

Katyar automatically captures and exposes **full metadata and context** for every agent interaction, making outputs interpretable and decisions traceable.

**Evaluation Criteria**  
The control is considered satisfied when:

- More than **90%** of logged events in the last 30 days contain complete metadata (input prompt, context, tool details, output, latency, risk score, policy decision).

**Evidence Captured**  
- Percentage of events with full metadata completeness  
- Required fields present: timestamp, agent_id, session_id, user prompt/input, tool/method, arguments, response/output, context metadata, outcome, latency_ms  
- Sample event payloads demonstrating transparency

**Key Katyar Capabilities Supporting This Control**

- **Complete Event & Trace Logging**  
  Every decision includes original prompt, full context dictionary, tool call details, raw & processed output, and metadata.

- **Structured & Searchable Audit Logs**  
  Events are stored with millisecond precision; dashboard provides instant search, filtering and deep inspection.

- **Input → Output Traceability**  
  Clear chain from user input → agent reasoning (if available) → final output and any policy/HITL modification.

- **Export-Ready Transparency**  
  One-click CSV/JSON export of full event logs — suitable for deployer review or regulatory submission.

- **Deployer-Friendly Dashboard**  
  Real-time event stream with expandable details for non-technical users to understand system behavior.

**Recommended Actions to Strengthen Compliance**

1. Ensure agents are onboarded via the SDK (`katyar.init()` or session creation) — un-onboarded agents do not contribute to transparency score.
2. Include meaningful context in tool calls (e.g., user_id, session_id, channel, confidence score).
3. Use structured tool responses rather than plain strings when possible.
4. Generate regular activity to maintain recent events.
5. Check the Compliance dashboard → EU-13.1 card to verify >90% completeness.
6. Export recent logs periodically and review for any missing fields.

**What Auditors Typically Look For**

- High metadata completeness across recent events (>90% preferred)
- Traceability from input → output
- Accessibility of logs for deployers (searchable, exportable)
- Relevance of captured data for explaining decisions
- Consistency even under error or high-load conditions

Katyar exceeds the Article 13 minimum by providing **structured, real-time, export-ready transparency** — turning a regulatory obligation into a practical tool for debugging, trust-building, and responsible AI operations.
