title: EU-9.1 – Risk Management System
description: EU AI Act Article 9 requirement for a risk management system in high-risk AI
---



**Framework**: EU AI Act  
**Article**: 9

**Clause Description**  
High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed with a **risk management system** that shall be continuously run throughout the entire lifecycle of the high-risk AI system. The risk management system shall consist of a continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of the high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic updating. It shall comprise the following steps:  
(a) identification and analysis of the known and foreseeable risks  
(b) estimation and evaluation of the risks  
(c) evaluation of other possibly arising risks  
(d) adoption of appropriate risk management measures  
(e) testing of the high-risk AI system  
(f) monitoring, reporting and documentation of serious incidents and malfunctions.

**Why Implemented**  
The risk management system is the backbone of the EU AI Act for high-risk systems. It forces providers and deployers to proactively identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks across the full AI lifecycle — preventing foreseeable harm, reducing residual risks to an acceptable level, and ensuring ongoing safety after deployment. Without it, organizations cannot demonstrate due diligence or traceability when incidents occur.

**How Katyar Satisfies It**

Katyar implements the risk management system requirement through **granular, intent-aware policy controls** that cover different tools, actions, and risk vectors — creating a living set of mitigation measures that evolve with usage.

**Evaluation Criteria**  
Katyar considers the control satisfied when:

- At least **3 distinct policies** exist that cover **different tools or action types** (e.g., one for database writes, one for payment refunds, one for external API calls).

**Evidence Collected (Quantitative)**  
- Total number of active policies  
- Number of unique tools targeted by policies  
- Diversity of rule types (e.g., approval, deny, mask PII, require context)  
- Coverage of high-risk categories (financial, data access, external communication, etc.)  
- Policy creation/revision timestamps (to show ongoing iteration)

**Katyar Features That Enable Risk Management**

- **Policy Engine with Tool-Level Granularity**  
  Policies can target specific tools (via MCP), methods, parameters, amounts, users, or time windows.

- **MCP Hub Integration**  
  Tools are discovered and schema-enforced — policies can block invalid or risky parameter combinations before execution.

- **Semantic Firewall Layer**  
  Prompt injection, jailbreak, PII leakage, and secrets exfiltration are automatically detected and mitigated.

- **Iterative & Living Controls**  
  Policies can be created, edited, versioned, and tested in real time via dashboard or CLI.

- **Audit & Monitoring Loop**  
  Every policy decision, guardrail detection, and HITL action is logged — feeding back into risk assessment.

- **Recommendations Engine**  
  Dashboard suggests new policies based on observed gaps (e.g., "No policy covers bulk email → high risk of spam/phishing").

**Remediation Steps to Strengthen This Control**

1. Identify your high-risk tools/actions (e.g., database, payments, email, code deployment).  
2. Create at least 3 separate policies, each targeting a different tool or risk type:  
   - Policy 1: Require approval for payment refunds > $500  
   - Policy 2: Deny destructive SQL commands (DROP, DELETE without WHERE)  
   - Policy 3: Mask PII before returning database query results  
3. Save and enable the policies in the dashboard.  
4. Run agent scenarios that exercise each policy.  
5. Verify in the Compliance dashboard → EU-9.1 card that the control is satisfied (≥ 3 distinct policies shown).  
6. Periodically review and add more policies as new tools or risks emerge.

**Auditor Expectations**  
Regulators expect to see:  
- Evidence of **multiple, targeted risk controls** (not a single generic policy)  
- Coverage across **different tools and risk categories**  
- Ongoing iteration (policy creation dates, revisions)  
- Traceability from observed risks → specific mitigation measures  
- Demonstration that risks are actively reduced (e.g., blocked events, masked outputs)

Katyar turns the abstract "risk management system" requirement into a **concrete, measurable, and evolvable set of controls** — giving you both real safety and strong, data-backed proof for compliance audits.
