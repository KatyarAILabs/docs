title: What is Katyar?
description: Secure governance and compliance platform for autonomous AI agents in regulated enterprises.
---




**Katyar is the zero-trust control plane purpose-built for autonomous AI agents in regulated enterprises.**

It sits between your agents and critical systems — enforcing strong identity, intent-aware authorization, semantic threat prevention, graduated human oversight, full traceability, and quantitative compliance scoring across EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, UK ICO, DORA, NIS2, and SOC 2.

Katyar delivers **verifiable autonomy** — agents operate freely within defined boundaries, but never unchecked.  
Compliance scores start at **0%** and rise only when real controls are exercised — no inflated metrics, no false green.

## The Problem: The Agent "Trust Gap"

Enterprises want **production-scale agentic workflows**, but face blocked adoption due to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ghost Agents" icon="ghost">
    No verifiable identity, excessive privileges, and impossible to audit or revoke access for autonomous actors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Semantic Attacks" icon="bug">
    Prompt injection, jailbreaks, and memory poisoning that bypass traditional WAFs and API gateways.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High-Risk Autonomy" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Money movement, production changes, and PII access running fully unattended without oversight.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regulatory Pressure" icon="scale-balanced">
    EU AI Act, DORA, NIS2, and NIST RMF demanding HITL, explainability, and rigorous audit trails.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Result: **Risk-averse scaling**. Teams build agents, but production deployment waits for verifiable control.

## How Katyar Protects Your Agents

Katyar enforces **four integrated layers of protection** in real time:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. Strong Federated Identity" icon="fingerprint">
    Agents anchored to enterprise identity (Clerk + OIDC/SAML). No static keys, no anonymous sessions — every action traceable to a named identity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Semantic Firewall" icon="shield-virus">
    Real-time scanning (`&lt;100 ms`) blocks prompt injection, jailbreaks, PII leakage, and toxic content using LLM Guard + rule engine.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Intent-Aware Policy" icon="traffic-light">
    Granular, condition-based authorization (tool, method, parameters, amount, time) with native MCP support for filtered tool discovery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Graduated HITL" icon="user-gear">
    High-risk actions pause and route to Slack/Teams/Dashboard for review with timeout, escalation, and mandatory justification.
  </Card>

## Key Enterprise Outcomes

| Challenge | Katyar Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Uncontrolled Privileges** | Verifiable identity + least-privilege enforcement |
| **Semantic Attacks** | Sub-100 ms guardrail blocking + detection logs |
| **Lack of Oversight** | Configurable HITL with escalation & justification |
| **Manual Compliance** | Automatic 21-control scoring + exportable evidence |
| **Shadow AI** | Centralized agent inventory + onboarding gating |
| **Fearful Rollout** | Safe, auditable path to production autonomy |

## Who Should Use Katyar?

- **Financial Services**: DORA, EU AI Act, PSD3 compliance
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA, EU AI Act, ISO 27001 alignment
- **Critical Infrastructure**: NIS2, CISA, EU AI Act requirements
- **Enterprise Standards**: SOC 2 Type II, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF
- **Agent Builders**: Scaling customer service, DevOps, and sales enablement agents

## The Bottom Line

In 2026 and beyond, AI is **action-oriented** — and action without control is liability.

Katyar is the platform that makes autonomous actions **safe, auditable, compliant, and provably governed**.
