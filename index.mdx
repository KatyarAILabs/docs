Governance, security, compliance & human oversight for autonomous AI agents

**Katyar is the control plane for enterprise AI agents.**

It ensures every tool call is authenticated, policy-checked, guardrail-scanned, optionally human-reviewed, fully traced, cost-metered, and scored against real regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST RMF, UK ICO).

Start at **0% compliance** — improve only when actual controls are exercised.

One line activates everything:

```python
import katyar
katyar.init("kt_live_your_key_here")
```
