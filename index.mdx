description: Compliance & human oversight for autonomous AI agents
---





**Katyar is the control plane for enterprise AI agents.**

It ensures every tool call is authenticated, optionally human-reviewed, fully traced, cost-metered, and scored against real regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, UK ICO, DORA, NIS2, SOC 2).

Start at **0% compliance** — improve only when actual controls are exercised.


```python
import katyar
katyar.init("kt_live_your_key_here")
