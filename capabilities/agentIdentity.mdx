title: Agent Identity & Access Control
---



Katyar eliminates “ghost agents” by giving every agent a **verifiable enterprise identity**.

### Key Features

- Federated authentication via **Auth0 / Okta** (OIDC / JWT)
- Agents authenticate with short-lived JWTs (machine-to-machine or on-behalf-of flows)
- NATS Auth Callout verifies identity on every connection
- **Task Tokens** — dynamically down-scoped tokens per task / conversation (e.g. 30-minute TTL, only allow SQL read)
- Optional hardware/container **attestation** (AWS Nitro, confidential containers)
- Agent groups & role-based scoping (marketing-agents, finance-agents, devops-agents)

### Outcomes

- Every action is traceable to a real enterprise principal
- No static API keys embedded in code or containers
- Granular access: an agent sees only the tools its identity permits
- Full non-repudiation for audits and incident response
