**Katyar is the first purpose-built security and governance operating system for autonomous AI agents in the enterprise.**

It is the control plane that sits between your AI agents and your critical enterprise systems — ensuring every action is **authenticated**, **authorized**, **inspected for intent**, **auditable**, and — when the stakes are high — **approved by a human**.

Katyar closes the **AI Trust Gap** that is currently preventing most large organizations from moving from experimental pilots to production-scale autonomous agents.

## The Problem Katyar Solves

In 2026, enterprises face a painful reality:

- AI agents are powerful but behave like **ghost users** — no real identity, excessive privileges, impossible to audit
- Traditional security tools (firewalls, WAFs, API gateways) are blind to **agent intent** and **semantic attacks** (prompt injection, jailbreaking, memory poisoning)
- High-risk actions — moving money, changing production infrastructure, sending mass communications, accessing PII — happen automatically with **no oversight**
- Regulators are already demanding **human-in-the-loop controls**, **explainability**, and **full audit trails** for agentic systems (EU AI Act, NIST, UK ICO, DORA, etc.)
- 40%+ of early agentic projects are being cancelled or delayed due to unaddressed governance and risk exposure (Gartner 2026)

The result: organizations are stuck in **“skeptical adoption”** — they want autonomy, but they don’t trust it.

## What Katyar Actually Does

Katyar turns **zero-trust principles into zero-trust autonomy** by enforcing four layers of protection in real time:

1. **Strong Federated Identity**  
   Every agent is anchored to an enterprise identity (Auth0/Okta OIDC) — no more anonymous or static API-key ghost agents.

2. **Semantic Firewall**  
   Real-time inspection of prompts, tool calls, and outputs to detect and block prompt injection, jailbreaks, PII leakage, secrets exfiltration, and malicious intent (powered by guard models + rule-based engines).

3. **Policy Engine + MCP Hub**  
   Fine-grained, intent-aware authorization: which agents can see/call which tools, with what parameters, under what conditions. Native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support ensures schema-safe, filtered tool access.

4. **Async Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**  
   High-risk decisions (e.g. refunds > $1,000, production deploys, bulk emails) automatically pause and route to Slack/Teams/dashboard for human review — with timeout, escalation, and full audit trail.

## Key Outcomes Enterprises Get with Katyar

| Before Katyar                              | After Katyar                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Ghost agents with unlimited access         | Every action tied to verifiable enterprise identity |
| No visibility into what agents are doing   | Real-time dashboard + complete signed audit logs  |
| Prompt injection succeeds regularly        | Semantic firewall blocks most attacks in &lt;100ms   |
| High-risk actions run fully autonomously   | Graduated HITL + approval workflows               |
| Auditors ask for months of manual evidence | One-click compliance reports and exports          |
| Slow, fearful rollout of agents            | Safe, accelerated path to production autonomy     |

## Who Should Use Katyar?

- Enterprises already running or piloting **agentic workflows** (customer service, data analysis, DevOps automation, sales enablement, multi-agent orchestration)
- Teams in regulated industries (financial services, healthcare, insurance, government, critical infrastructure)
- Organizations subject to **EU AI Act**, **DORA**, **SOC 2**, **ISO 42001**, **NIST AI RMF**, or similar frameworks
- Any company that wants to move beyond chat-based GenAI into **action-oriented autonomous agents** without taking massive security and compliance risk

## The Bottom Line

In 2024–2025, generative AI was mostly about **conversation**.  
In 2026 and beyond, AI is about **action**.

Katyar is the platform that makes those actions **safe**, **auditable**, **compliant**, and **enterprise-ready** — so your organization can finally unlock the full economic potential of autonomous agents without betting the company on un-governed autonomy.
