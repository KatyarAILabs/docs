title: EU-14.3 – Real-time Intervention
description: EU AI Act Article 14.4(c) requirement for real-time human intervention in high-risk AI systems
---

**Framework**: EU AI Act  
**Article**: 14.4(c)

**Official Requirement**  
Human oversight measures shall enable the individuals to whom human oversight is assigned to **intervene to interrupt**, through a "stop" button or a similar procedure, the functioning of the high-risk AI system.

**How Katyar Addresses This Requirement**

Katyar implements real-time intervention through its **policy engine’s deny mechanism**, which acts as an equivalent to a "stop" procedure by preventing execution of high-risk actions before they reach tools or external systems.

**Evaluation Criteria**  
Katyar considers the control satisfied when:

- At least one active policy contains an explicit 'deny' rule (or equivalent blocking condition) that can interrupt agent execution.

**Evidence Collected (Quantitative)**  
- Number of policies that include 'deny' or blocking actions  
- Specific rule conditions (e.g., amount > $10,000, destructive SQL keywords, bulk sensitive operations)  
- Historical count of denied/blocked events triggered by these rules (last 30 days)  
- Latency between detection and interruption (typically < 100 ms)

**Katyar Features That Enable Real-time Intervention**

- **Semantic Firewall + Policy Engine**  
  In-line inspection blocks execution before any tool call or external action occurs.

- **Conditional Deny Rules**  
  Policies support precise conditions (e.g., tool = "database", query contains "DROP" → deny; amount > 5000 → deny).

- **Immediate Agent Interruption**  
  On deny: workflow halts, custom error message returned to agent, no further processing occurs.

- **Semantic & Keyword Blocking**  
  Prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, or dangerous commands are caught early via guardrails.

- **Audit-Ready Logging**  
  Every denied/blocked action is signed and logged with:  
  - Full request payload  
  - Matching policy ID and rule  
  - Reason for denial  
  - Timestamp (millisecond precision)

- **Dashboard Visibility**  
  Blocked events appear in real-time event stream with red indicators, policy match details, and quick links to the blocking policy.

**Recommended Steps to Strengthen This Control**

1. Create at least one policy with an explicit 'deny' action for a clearly high-risk pattern.  
   Examples:  
   - Block destructive SQL (DROP, DELETE without WHERE)  
   - Block refunds > $10,000 without escalation  
   - Block external API calls to unapproved domains

2. Test the policy by running agent scenarios that would trigger the deny rule.

3. Verify denials appear in:  
   - Real-time Events feed (red blocked icons)  
   - Audit logs (search for outcome = "denied" or "blocked")  
   - Compliance dashboard → EU-14.3 card

4. Aim for multiple deny rules covering different risk vectors to show comprehensive coverage.

**Auditor Expectations**  
Regulators expect to see:  
- Demonstration that intervention is **immediate** (execution stopped before harm)  
- Evidence of **actual blocking events** in logs (not just rule existence)  
- Clear mapping between high-risk scenarios and the deny rules that cover them  
- Low latency between detection and interruption  
- Traceability: which policy/rule triggered the stop, and why

Katyar’s deny-based intervention is **faster than manual stop buttons** (sub-100 ms enforcement) while remaining fully auditable and configurable — providing both proactive safety and strong regulatory proof.
