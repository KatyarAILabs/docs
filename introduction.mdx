title: What is Katyar?
description: The governance & compliance operating system for autonomous AI agents in the enterprise
---



**Katyar is the first purpose-built security and governance operating system for autonomous AI agents in the enterprise.**

It is the **control plane** that sits between your AI agents and your critical enterprise systems — ensuring every action is:

- **Authenticated** (strong federated identity, no ghost agents)  
- **Authorized** (intent-aware policies + MCP tool governance)  
- **Inspected for intent** (semantic firewall + LLM Guard)  
- **Auditable** (signed event logs + traces)  
- **Human-reviewed when it matters** (async HITL approvals via Slack/Teams/dashboard)

Katyar closes the **AI Trust Gap** — the reason most large organizations are still stuck in pilots instead of running production-scale autonomous agents at scale.

## The Problem Katyar Solves

Enterprises want **autonomy**, but regulators and security teams demand **verifiable control**.

Right now you face:

- Agents acting like **ghost users** — no real identity, excessive privileges, impossible to audit
- Traditional security tools (WAFs, API gateways) are **blind** to prompt injection, jailbreaks, memory poisoning, and agent intent
- High-risk actions (money movement, prod changes, bulk emails, PII access) happen **fully autonomously** with zero oversight
- Regulators are enforcing **human-in-the-loop**, **explainability**, and **full audit trails** (EU AI Act, DORA, NIST, UK ICO, etc.)
- 40–60% of early agentic projects are being **delayed or cancelled** due to unaddressed governance risk (Gartner & Forrester 2026)

Result: **skeptical adoption** — everyone wants agents, but nobody trusts them at scale.

## What Katyar Actually Does

Katyar enforces **four layers of zero-trust protection** in real time:

1. **Strong Federated Identity**  
   Every agent is anchored to an enterprise identity (Auth0/Okta OIDC). No static keys, no anonymous agents.

2. **Semantic Firewall + Guardrails**  
   Real-time scanning for prompt injection, jailbreaks, PII leakage, secrets exfiltration, harmful content — powered by LLM Guard + rule engines (`<100` ms).

3. **Intent-Aware Policy Engine + MCP Hub**  
   Fine-grained authorization: which agents can call which tools, with what parameters, under what conditions. Native MCP support for schema-safe, filtered tool access.

4. **Graduated Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**  
   High-risk actions (refunds > $1k, prod deploys, bulk sensitive ops) pause and route to Slack/Teams/dashboard for human review — with timeout, escalation, delegation, and full audit trail.

## Key Outcomes Enterprises Get

|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Ghost agents with unlimited access         | Every action tied to verifiable enterprise identity |
| No visibility into agent behavior          | Real-time dashboard + complete signed audit logs |
| Prompt injection succeeds regularly        | Semantic firewall blocks most attacks in &lt;100 ms |
| High-risk actions run fully autonomously   | Graduated HITL + approval workflows              |
| Auditors demand months of manual evidence  | One-click compliance reports + evidence links    |
| Slow, fearful rollout of agents            | Safe, accelerated path to production autonomy    |

## Who Should Use Katyar?

- Enterprises already running or piloting **agentic workflows**  
  (customer service, data analysis, DevOps automation, sales enablement, multi-agent orchestration)
- Teams in regulated industries  
  (financial services, healthcare, insurance, government, critical infrastructure)
- Organizations subject to **EU AI Act**, **DORA**, **SOC 2**, **ISO 42001**, **NIST AI RMF**, or similar
- Any company that wants to move from **chat-based GenAI** to **action-oriented autonomous agents** without massive security/compliance risk

## The Bottom Line

In 2024–2025, generative AI was mostly about **conversation**.  
In 2026 and beyond, AI is about **action**.

Katyar is the platform that makes those actions **safe**, **auditable**, **compliant**, and **enterprise-ready** — so your organization can finally unlock the full economic potential of autonomous agents without betting the company on ungoverned autonomy.
