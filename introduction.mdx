## Katyar — Verifiable Compliance for Autonomous AI Agents

**Katyar is the zero-trust control plane purpose-built to make autonomous AI agents compliant in regulated enterprises.**

It sits between your agents and critical systems — enforcing strong traceability, graduated human oversight, automated quantitative compliance scoring, and full audit readiness across EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, UK ICO, DORA, NIS2, and SOC 2.

Katyar delivers **verifiable autonomy** — agents operate freely within defined boundaries, with compliance scores that start at **0%** and rise only when real controls are exercised — no inflated metrics, no false green.

## The Compliance Gap Blocking Agent Adoption

Enterprises want production-scale agentic workflows but are stalled by three critical compliance problems:

### 1. Regulatory Fines

Non-compliance with major frameworks — especially the **EU AI Act** — can trigger fines of up to **€35 million or 7% of global annual turnover**, whichever is higher.

- High-risk AI systems without proper oversight and documentation are automatically non-compliant  
- Lack of explainability, traceability, or human review = direct violation  
- One serious incident can trigger investigations and multimillion-euro penalties

### 2. Hidden Agent Risks

Agents silently call external APIs, access PII, modify production systems, or execute high-stakes tools without meaningful oversight — creating massive undetected liability.

- Actions lack verifiable provenance  
- No automatic pause or justification for risky decisions  
- Shadow / ungoverned agents proliferate across teams

### 3. Compliance via Spreadsheets

Manual evidence collection is slow, error-prone, and instantly outdated the moment an agent ships new code or behavior changes.

- Audit trails become incomplete overnight  
- Regulators receive stale or inconsistent evidence  
- Teams waste weeks preparing for every audit
Result: **Risk-averse paralysis**. Teams build powerful agents in sandboxes, but production deployment remains blocked indefinitely.

## How Katyar Closes the Compliance Gap

Katyar enforces compliance in real time through four tightly integrated layers:

1. **Full Traceability**  
   Every agent action is logged and anchored to a verifiable enterprise identity — complete provenance for audits.

2. **Graduated Human Oversight (HITL)**  
   High-risk actions automatically pause and route to Slack / Teams / dashboard for review — with timeouts, escalation paths, and mandatory justification logs.

3. **Quantitative Compliance Scoring**  
   Starts at 0% — increases only when controls are demonstrably exercised — exportable evidence pack for regulators (21+ controls aligned to EU AI Act, DORA, NIS2, SOC 2, NIST AI RMF, etc.).

4. **Centralized Agent Inventory**  
   Single view of all agents + gated onboarding to eliminate shadow AI deployments.

## Key Compliance Outcomes

| Challenge                        | Katyar Outcome                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Manual evidence collection       | Automatic scoring + exportable audit evidence       |
| Hidden / unmonitored agent risk  | Traceable logs + configurable HITL with justifications |
| Exposure to multimillion-euro fines | Provable alignment with EU AI Act + major frameworks |
| Outdated compliance artifacts    | Real-time updates + always-current scoring          |
| Shadow AI deployments            | Centralized inventory + enforced onboarding         |

## Who Should Use Katyar?

Every **agentic AI company** that wants to:

- Make their agents **compliant** with EU AI Act, DORA, NIS2, SOC 2 and similar frameworks  
- Avoid paying **multimillion-euro fines** for non-compliance

Especially teams building or deploying agents in:

- Financial services  
- Insurance  
- Healthcare  
- Critical infrastructure  
- Any customer-facing or high-stakes enterprise vertical

## The Bottom Line

In 2026 and beyond, autonomous AI is action-oriented — and action without **verifiable, auditable compliance** is a direct path to regulatory penalties.

Katyar turns compliance from a painful, manual bottleneck into a **scalable, automated enabler** — so your agents can move to production safely, provably, and without the fear of €35M fines.
