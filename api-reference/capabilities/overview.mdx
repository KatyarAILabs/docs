Katyar is not just another API gateway or monitoring tool.  
It is a complete **governance plane** purpose-built for autonomous AI agents — giving enterprises strong identity, semantic safety, intent-aware policies, and graduated human oversight.

Below are the four core capability pillars that make Katyar the foundation for safe agentic automation in 2026 and beyond.

<Card title="1. Agent Identity & Access Control" href="/capabilities/agent-identity">
  Strong, federated identity for every agent. No ghost users. Dynamic task-scoped access. Full non-repudiation.
</Card>

<Card title="2. Semantic Protection & Threat Detection" href="/capabilities/semantic-protection">
  Real-time defense against prompt injection, jailbreaks, PII leakage, secrets exfiltration, and emerging semantic attacks.
</Card>

<Card title="3. Policy & Governance Engine" href="/capabilities/policy-engine">
  Fine-grained, business-logic-aware authorization. Visual + Cedar policies. MCP-native tool governance.
</Card>

<Card title="4. Human-in-the-Loop & Oversight" href="/capabilities/human-in-the-loop">
  Async, low-friction approvals for high-stakes actions — integrated into Slack, Teams, dashboard, or custom workflows.

### Why These Capabilities Matter in 2026

- Regulators require **verifiable identity** + **human oversight** for high-risk AI systems (EU AI Act, NIST, DORA, UK ICO)
- Enterprises lose **millions** to prompt-engineered attacks and unauthorized agent actions
- Agent projects stall because teams cannot prove **auditability** or **risk control**
- Multi-agent systems need **isolation** and **blast-radius limitation** — Katyar enforces it natively

Each capability is deeply integrated — identity feeds policy, semantic checks run before policy evaluation, HITL triggers only on policy-flagged high-risk events, and everything is logged with cryptographic integrity.
